# Virtual-person-posture-rotation-representation-and-loss-calculation-tool
This is my internship project in NetEase game AI Lab: multi-modal virtual human interaction, through the text to predict the virtual human action and then generate animation through Unity rendering, enhance the interactive experience of virtual characters. This is the calculation tool I used to refer to the Python version written independently by the relevant C code, including quaternions, rotation vectors, Euler angles, and the loss function between the predicted rotation and the true rotation. This part I listed separately as a calculation tool for everyone to use in the game AI experiment development process. QuartClass is a class that integrates all functions. I have tested all the features and it is stable and feasible.
